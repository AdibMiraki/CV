## SUMMARY
With about 4 years of experience in computational biology, I specialize in single cell data analysis and bioinformatics area.
My passion lies in utilizing AI and machine learning techniques to further the fields of tumor immunotherapy and neuroscience.
I have collaborated with several pioneer institutes such as Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, Sanger Institute, and University of Calgary,
merging biological and computational aspects of different diseases to gain a deeper understanding of them. My goal is to continue
to combine my expertise in both the biological and computational fields to pave the way for new medical breakthroughs that can positively impact society.
